# Matching Engine (Mini Exchange)

Simple, single-threaded limit order book in C++ with price-time priority. It keeps bids/asks in memory, supports limit orders, partial fills, cancel by order id, and emits trades when orders match.

`submit` returns a `SubmitResult`:
- `accepted`: whether the order passed validation and entered matching.
- `trades`: trades generated by that submission.

Validation currently rejects:
- duplicate order ids already resting in the book,
- non-positive price,
- non-positive quantity.

## Layout
- `src/` core matching engine and book code.
- `tests/` assertions for matching, partial fills, cancel behavior, and safety validation.

## Build and run
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/matching_engine_app
```

## Next steps
- Add market orders.
- Add basic performance benchmarking.
- Add rejection reason codes to `SubmitResult` (instead of just `accepted`).

## Run tests
```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
