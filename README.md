# Matching Engine (Mini Exchange)

Simple, single-threaded limit order book in C++ with price-time priority. It keeps bids/asks in memory, supports limit and market orders, partial fills, cancel/replace by order id, IOC/GTC time-in-force, and emits trades when orders match.

`submit` returns a `SubmitResult`:
- `accepted`: whether the order passed validation and entered matching.
- `reject_reason`: why an order was rejected (`NONE` for accepted orders).
- `trades`: trades generated by that submission.

Validation currently rejects:
- duplicate order ids already resting in the book,
- non-positive price,
- non-positive quantity,
- market orders when the opposite book has no liquidity,
- replace requests for unknown order ids.

Prices are represented internally as integer ticks (`PriceTicks`) to avoid floating-point precision errors.
Use `price_to_ticks(...)` when constructing orders and `ticks_to_price(...)` only when formatting output.

## Layout
- `src/` core matching engine and book code.
- `tests/` assertions for matching, partial fills, cancel behavior, and safety validation.

## Build and run
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
./build/matching_engine_app
```

Replay mode:
```bash
./build/matching_engine_app replay tests/data/replay_basic.csv
./build/matching_engine_app replay tests/data/replay_basic.csv /tmp/trades.csv
```

Replay mode parses CSV rows, sorts them deterministically by `(ts_ns, seq, original_file_order)`,
replays them through the engine APIs, and prints a summary.

TWAP backtest mode (Piece 1):
```bash
./build/matching_engine_app backtest_twap tests/data/backtest_twap_basic.csv BUY 6 3
```

Backtest mode replays the market CSV, injects market child orders on a TWAP schedule,
and prints execution metrics:
- fill quantity/rate,
- arrival benchmark and average fill price,
- implementation shortfall (bps),
- participation rate against replay market volume.

Time-in-force behavior:
- `GTC`: leftover quantity rests in the book.
- `IOC`: leftover quantity is canceled immediately.

Order type behavior:
- `LIMIT`: matches only at limit price or better.
- `MARKET`: matches immediately against best opposite prices and never rests leftover quantity.

Replace behavior:
- Same price and quantity decrease (or unchanged quantity): keeps queue priority.
- Price change or quantity increase: loses queue priority (effectively cancel + new submit).

Market data API behavior:
- `top_of_book()`: returns optional best bid/ask levels with aggregated quantity at each best price.
- `depth(n_levels)`: returns top `n_levels` aggregated levels for bids and asks.
- `event_log()` and `events_since(seq_num)`: provide sequenced incremental events (`ADD`, `TRADE`, `CANCEL`, `REPLACE`).

Replay CSV schema:
- Header must be exactly:
  - `ts_ns,seq,action,order_id,side,type,price,qty,tif,new_price,new_qty,notes`
- `action=NEW`: requires `side`, `type`, `qty`; `price` required for `LIMIT`, blank for `MARKET`.
- `action=CANCEL`: requires `order_id`.
- `action=REPLACE`: requires `order_id`, `new_price`, `new_qty`.
- Parsing errors include line numbers and stop replay.

## Next steps
- Add basic performance benchmarking.
- Extend execution backtesting beyond TWAP (for example VWAP/POV and richer slippage analysis).

## Run tests
```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
